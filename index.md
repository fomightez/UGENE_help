(Technical note: This file `index.md` was generated with text from `README.md` as a workaround for recently developed bug in mkdocs handling at Read the Docs. See [here](https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues/1615) for details and suggestions. If fixed to again match what [documentation currently says]( https://read-the-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/builds.html), this file won't be necessary and `README.md` will again be used as it was before.)
