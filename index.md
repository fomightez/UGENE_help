(Technical note: This file `index.md` added with text from `README.md` as workaround for bug in mkdocs handling that Read the Docs currently has for current mkdocs builds. See https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues/1615 . If fixed to match what wiki currently says, this file won't be necessary and `README.md` will again be used.)
